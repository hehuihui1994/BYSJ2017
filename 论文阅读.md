特点：

- 1)自动构建了一个很大的细粒度Twitter情绪数据集

  ( built a large, automatically curated dataset for emotion detection using **distant supervision**)

- 2)深度学习方法 3-Dense-GRU

- 3)24个类别 acc **0.8758**

- 4)Robert Plutchik’s 8 primary emotion dimensions acc **0.9668**



## 收集数据

We collect tweets with emotion-carrying hashtags 

we developed a list of hashtags representing each of the 24 emotions proposed by Robert Plutchick (Plutchik, 1980, 1985, 1994).



种子词：

For each emotion type, we prepared a seed set of hashtags representing the emotion. We used Google synonyms and other online dic- tionaries and thesauri (e.g., www.thesaurus.com) to expand the initial seed set of each emo- tion. We acquire a total of 665 emotion hash- tags across the 24 emotion types. For exam- ple, for the joy emotion, a subset of the seeds in our expanded set is {“happy”, “happiness”, “joy”, “joyful”, “joyfully”, “delighted”, “feel- ingsunny”, “blithe”, “beatific”, “exhilarated”, “blissful”, “walkingonair”, “jubilant”}. 



获取tweet:

- We then used the expanded set to extract tweets with **hashtags** from the set from a number of massive-scale in-house Twitter datasets.
- We also used Twitter API to crawl Twitter with **hashtags** from the expanded set.

构造数据集：

acquire a dataset of about **1/4 billion tweets** covering an extended time span from July 2009 till January 2017.（2.5亿）



## 预处理

clean the data and remove duplicates

( cleaning, filtering, language identification, and deduplication )

- first removed all tweets with hashtags belonging to more than one emotion of the 24 emotion categories. (单分类任务)
- hashtags in tweets with URLs are less likely to correlate with a true emotion label, we remove all tweets with URLs from our data.
- filter out duplicates using a two-step procedure
  - remove all retweets (based on existence of the token “RT” regardless of case)
  - use the Python library pandas http://pandas.pydata.org/   “drop duplicates” method to compare the tweet texts of all the tweets   after normalizing character repetitions [all consecutive characters of > 2 to 2] and user mentions (as de- tected by a string starting with an “@” sign).
  - We then performed a manual inspection of a random sample of 1,000 tweets from the data and found no evidence of any remaining tweet duplicates.（检查）
- filter out non-English.  use the langid (Lui and Baldwin, 2012) (https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py) library to assign language tags to the tweets.

counts of tweets with at least 5 words and the emotion hashtags occurring as the final word in the tweet text.

acquire a total of 1,608,233 tweets: 205,125 tweets for plutchik-1, 790,059 for plutchik-2, and 613,049 for plutchik-3.

## 方法



Dense  GRU





## 实验



数据集设置：We then split the data representing each of the 3 circles into 80% training (TRAIN), 10% development (DEV), and 10% testing (TEST).



参数设置： To train the GRNNs, we optimize the hyper-parameters of the network on a development set as we describe below, choosing a vocabulary size of 80K words (a vocabulary size we also use for the out-of-core classifiers), a word embedding vector of size 300 dimensions learnt directly from the training data, an input maximum length of 30 words, 7 epochs, and the Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. **We use 3 dense layers each with 1, 000 units**. We use dropout (Hinton et al., 2012) for regularization, with a dropout rate of 0.5. For our loss function, we use categorical cross-entropy. We use a mini- batch (Cotter et al., 2011) size of 128.
